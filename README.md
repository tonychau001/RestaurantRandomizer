# RestaurantRandomizer

This project is under construction. The idea behind it is simple. How many times have
your partner and/or yourself being undecisive about where to eat? No one have time for those
kind of arguments, and that is what this app is for! You could enter a city or zipcode, and
it will randomly choose a restaurant for you.
